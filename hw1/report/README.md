## How much time did you spend on this project

I spent approximately 3 hours on this assignment.

## Project overview

This project involved creating a lexical analyzer for the P language. The program parses input files, tokenizes the content, and outputs the tokens along with relevant information such as line numbers and types. It utilizes Lex syntax to define patterns and corresponding actions for recognizing tokens, identifiers, constants, comments, and other language constructs. The output provides insights into the structure of the input code, aiding in further compilation or analysis phases.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

The most challenging aspect of this project was likely handling various language constructs and edge cases. Specifically, managing the state transitions for different contexts, such as comments or string literals, required careful consideration to avoid misinterpretation or incorrect tokenization.

## Feedback to T.A.s

None.
