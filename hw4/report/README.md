## How much time did you spend on this project

1 week.

## Project overview

This project is about extending the parser from the previous assignments to perform semantic analysis for a given program written in the P language. The main steps involved are:

1. Add the `has_error` flag
2. Add the inferred type for the `ExpressionNode`
3. Add the `D` pseudocomment for the dump symbol table option
4. Build the `SymbolManager` and related classes, e.g., `SymbolEntry`, `SymbolTable`
5. Make sure the parsing flow is correct by passing the first testcase
6. Add semantic analysis functions for the language constructs

## What is the hardest you think in this project

Semantic analysis in binary operations.

## Feedback to T.A.s

None.
